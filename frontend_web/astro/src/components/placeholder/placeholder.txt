components Folder
The components folder contains reusable UI components that are used throughout the application. Each component is typically self-contained, with its own JavaScript/JSX file for the component logic and a corresponding CSS file for styling. This modular approach helps in maintaining a clean and organized codebase, making it easier to manage and reuse components across different parts of the application.

Example Components:
NavBar: The navigation bar component that includes the logo, navigation links, and buttons for login and sign-up.
Footer: The footer component that appears at the bottom of the pages, containing links and other relevant information.
Button: A reusable button component that can be customized with different styles and behaviors.
Each component is designed to be reusable and customizable, allowing for consistent design and functionality across the application.
